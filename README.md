This is the work-in-progress project of my capstone project for a data science bootcamp. It will be used to keep my coaches and peers up to date on my progress. A final version of the project will be made available as an individual GitHub project.

# Goal
The goal of this project is to predict for each item group of a chain of German bakeries the sales on a daily and monthly granularity. If the prediction is precise enough, it could prevent food waste and improve profitability for the bakery. The applied models should incorporate seasonal effects as well as externalities like specific weather conditions or public events to ensure the best possible predictive power. 

# Metrics
The metrics that are most important to this project are the deviance from predicted to true values. We do not want produce many more products than will be actually bought but we also do not want to produce less than we could sell. Thus, the metrics that the models will be optimized for are the average percentual deviance (<b>Mean Percentage Error</b>). To better illustrate the model performance to other stakeholders, we will also use the mse (<b>Mean Absolute Error</b>), so that business stakeholder get a better feel of how costly the over- or under-production based on the predictions would be.
